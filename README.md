**TL;DR:** Scaling SigNoz (YC W21) from $1→$10 — obsessed with activation, PLG loops, and making OpenTelemetry approachable.
      
## ⚙️ $whoami

I'm that weird person who enjoys both shipping code AND talking to users. Started as 1st engineer at [SigNoz](https://github.com/SigNoz), built the backend, then realized I really liked the "why are we building this?" questions. Now I do product full-time but still code when nobody's looking.

### 🔭 What I'm actually doing
Currently scaling **SigNoz** (YC W21) from $1 \to 10$.
* **Day Job:** obsessing over activation rates, PLG loops, and making OpenTelemetry less scary for the average dev.
* **Past Life:** I was the first backend engineer at SigNoz. I optimized Trace DB performance by **40x** and page loads by **3x** because slow dashboards hurt my soul.
* **Before that:** Wrangled services at **OkCredit** handling **500k+ RPM**. I like systems that don't crash under pressure.

## 🛠️ Stuff I actually use (not buzzword bingo)

* **Languages:** Go · Python · Java · Ruby · JavaScript · C/C++
* **Databases & Infrastructure:** ClickHouse · Kubernetes · Docker · Postgres · Redis · OTEL
* **Product stuff:** Mixpanel • Segment • Metabase • Customer.io

## 🏆 Humble Brags (The "Trust Me, I Can Code" Section)

* Ranked 179 nationally in ICPC (out of 4441, so top 4%ish)
* Top 100 in HackWithInfy among 180k+ participants
* Won 2 hackathons at my previous company before they asked me to chill
* Solved 1000+ LeetCode-style problems (because apparently I enjoy pain)

## ⚡ Offline Mode
When I'm not staring at monitors, I am:
* Trying to reconcile **Vedanta** with **Stoicism**.
* Reading things that make me question my own opinions
* Being a **Minimalist** and an avid planner.
* Playing **Chess** (badly, but enthusiastically).
* Searching for the best vegetarian food in town.

## 💭 What I think about

* Making complex systems simple
* 0→1 products
* Why users churn
* Observability (it's my day job)
* How to make developer tools not suck
