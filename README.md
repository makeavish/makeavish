**TL;DR:** Scaling SigNoz (YC W21) from $1 \to 10$ — obsessed with activation, PLG loops, and making OpenTelemetry approachable.
      
## ⚙️ $whoami

I'm that weird person who enjoys both shipping code AND talking to users. Started as 1st engineer at [SigNoz](https://github.com/SigNoz), built the backend, then realized I really liked the "why are we building this?" questions. Now I do product full-time but still code when nobody's looking.

### 🔭 What I'm actually doing
Currently scaling **SigNoz** (YC W21) from $1 \to 10$.
* **Day Job:** obsessing over activation rates, PLG loops, and making OpenTelemetry less scary for the average dev.
* **Past Life:** I was the first backend engineer at SigNoz. I optimized Trace DB performance by **40x** and page loads by **3x** because slow dashboards hurt my soul.
* **Before that:** Wrangled services at **OkCredit** handling **500k+ RPM**. I like systems that don't crash under pressure.

## 🏆 Humble Brags

* Ranked 179 nationally in ICPC (out of 4441, so top 4%ish)
* Top 100 in HackWithInfy among 180k+ participants
* Won 2 hackathons at my previous company before they asked me to chill

## ⚡ Offline Mode
When I'm not staring at monitors, I am:
* Trying to reconcile **Vedanta** with **Stoicism**.
* Reading things that make me question my own opinions
* Playing **Chess** (badly, but enthusiastically).
* Thinking about:
  * Making complex systems simple
  * Observability & how to make dev tools not suck
